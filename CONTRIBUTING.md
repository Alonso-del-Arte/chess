I think I will definitely open this project to Hacktoberfest 2021. Even with the 
limitations specified in the Read Me, it's too big a project for one 
programmer.

# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 2021 Contributors

If I decide to open this project to Hacktoberfest 2021, I will consider pull 
requests associated with an issue and will also consider pull requests 
associated with a TODO (considered an Action Item in NetBeans). I will also 
consider pull requests pertaining to corrections to the Game Rules document.

Contributors should have a proper Java IDE (most are available for free) with a 
Scala plugin, and JUnit. I strongly recommend IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala for 
IntelliJ plugin. I don't recommend NetBeans only because the Scala plugin is 
not yet ready NetBeans 12. 

This project uses Scala 2.13 (and Java 8) and JUnit 5. Contributors may use 
later versions of Scala or Java provided they don't use features not available 
Scala 2 or in Java 8.

I don't expect contributors to be chess grandmasters (I'm certainly not), but I 
do expect them to know the basic rules of the game, and to be able to win a 
game against the computer on the easiest level.

Once the program is able to play chess by making its own decisions, it would be 
helpful to have it play different human players. But transparency is required 
for this: the human players should understand they're playing against the 
computer, and not against you. To let them believe otherwise could be considered 
cheating.

Per the license, this program could be used for many different purposes. The 
chief purposes should be to practice chess and to study the game.
