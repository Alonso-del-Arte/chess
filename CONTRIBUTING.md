This project is now open to Hacktoberfest 2023.

# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 2023 Contributors

I will consider pull requests associated with an issue and I will also consider 
pull requests associated with a TODO (considered an Action Item in NetBeans). I 
will also consider pull requests pertaining to corrections to the Game Rules 
document.

Contributors should have a proper Java IDE (most are available for free) with a 
Scala plugin, and JUnit. I strongly recommend IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala for 
IntelliJ plugin. I don't recommend NetBeans only because its Scala plugin is 
still in limbo. 

This project uses Scala 2.13 (and Java 8) and JUnit 5. Contributors may use 
later versions of Scala or Java provided they don't use features not available 
Scala 2 or in Java 8.

I don't expect contributors to be chess grandmasters (I'm certainly not), but I 
do expect them to know the basic rules of the game, and to be able to win a 
game against the computer on the easiest level.

Once the program is able to play chess by making its own decisions, it would be 
helpful to have it play different human players. But transparency is required 
for this: the human players should understand they're playing against the 
computer, and not against you. To let them believe otherwise could be considered 
cheating.

Per the license, this program could be used for many different purposes. The 
chief purposes should be to practice chess and to study the game.

Also, I would appreciate chess puzzles for the Puzzles.md file. You can use 
Lichess to generate the FENs. As for the accompanying text, besides the "White 
to play" or "Black to play" indication, you can either write it up yourself or 
leave it to me.

I reserve the right to ignore pull requests during the weekend. Unless maybe the 
end of Hacktoberfest falls on a weekend.
