# Chess

WORK IN PROGRESS: I think I'll just take this to the point of being a game 
between two human players, or I might make it so that you can play against the 
computer, but the computer only looks one move ahead.

This project is currently in the research phase. At this point I'm focusing more 
on studying the game than in programming it.

Scala 2.13 (with Java 8), JUnit 5.

It would be a good idea to make sure all the terms in Terminology.md are in the 
project dictionary.

I've decided to use the 
[ChessVideos.tv Diagram Generator](https://www.chessvideos.tv/chess-diagram-generator.php). 
That's licensed under BSD, which I hope is no problem with GPL.
