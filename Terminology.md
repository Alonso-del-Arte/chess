# Terminology

Like law, mathematics, and just about anything else, chess has its own 
terminology, some of it more obvious than others.

This is not intended to be comprehensive. I only intend to include the most 
commonly used terms, and those which might cause me confusion because they're 
common words used to mean somewhat different things in chess.

I also don't intend this document to conform to any official reference. 

## A

* **Accuracy** &mdash; How well someone plays. The fewer blunders, the higher 
the accuracy. Winning is good, winning with high accuracy is better. Of course 
it's possible to play with greater accuracy than your opponent and still lose 
(for example, if you play very well but then make a major blunder and your 
opponent seizes the opportunity, but doesn't choose the shortest way to a 
checkmate). On some chess websites, accuracy is measured by how much one plays 
as the website's best program would play.
* **Algebraic notation** &mdash; A notation for chess games in which the ranks 
and files of the board are numbered from White's perspective, and the starting 
position of a piece is generally omitted. It is the most common notation in use 
today. The term "algebraic" is somewhat of a misnomer.
* **Archbishop** &mdash; A nonstandard chess piece combining the capabilities of 
the bishop and the knight.

## B

* **B** &mdash; Notation for bishop.
* **Bishop** &mdash; Pieces which flank the king and queen at the beginning of 
the game, each player gets two of them. They move diagonally, provided no pieces 
of their own side are in the way. 
* **Black** &mdash; The player who always goes second, or the group of pieces 
that player controls. Depending on the chess set, the pieces may actually be a 
dark brown color, or some other dark color.
* **Blitz chess** &mdash; A timed game with each player getting three to five 
minutes. Compare ''rapid chess''.
* **Blunder** &mdash; A very bad mistake that could cost the player the game.

## C

* **Castling** &mdash; A special move in which the king and a rook come together 
for the king's protection. See the game rules for details.
* **Centipawn** &mdash; A measure of a position's value in terms of pawns. Some 
chess engines use centipawns to compare moves. A captured pawn means a loss of 
100 centipawns for the player who lost that pawn. Other than a pawn being worth 
100 centipawns, there's no agreement on how the pieces should be valued, and 
programmers are free to come up with their own valuations. The valuation closest 
to achieving consensus values a queen at 900 centipawns, a bishop or a knight at 
300 centipawns and a rook at 500 centipawns. Bobby Fischer once gave a valuation 
that is exactly like that except for valuing a bishop at 325 centipawns instead 
of 300. One situation in which a centipawn valuation would be useful is when the 
opponent's knight threatens to capture either the computer's queen or the 
computer's rook, and it's possible for the computer to move either of those out 
of the way and allow the other to be captured. Because the queen is almost 
always valued at more centipawns than the rook, the computer decides to move its 
queen out of the opposing knight's reach.
* **Chancellor** &mdash; A nonstandard chess piece combining the capabilities of 
a rook and a knight.
* **Check** &mdash; A threat of capture to a player's king. The checked player 
must get their king out of danger, even if it means allowing some other piece to 
be captured.
* **Checkmate** &mdash; A threat of capture to a player's king with no means of 
escape. Depending on context, checkmates may be considered checks.

## D

* **Descriptive notation** &mdash; An older notation in which each player's 
moves are reckoned from the player's perspective.

## E

* **Endgame** &mdash; The last few moves of a game in which most or all pieces 
have moved from their initial positions. Among players of roughly equal ability, 
both players have had pieces captured but usually both players still have pawns 
left.
* **Engine** &mdash; A computer program for assessing chess positions. It is 
cheating to use an engine to pretend to be a better player online than one is 
unassisted. 
* **English notation** &mdash; Synonym for ''descriptive notation''.
* **En passant** &mdash; A special move in which a pawn captures an opponent 
pawn. See the game rules for details.

## F

* **F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale des &Eacute;checs** &mdash; The 
International Chess Federation, which sets many standards for chess accepted 
worldwide.
* **Fianchetto** &mdash; A sequence of developing moves that gives a bishop 
access to a long diagonal of the board. For example, open by moving one of your 
knight's pawns forward one space, then on your next turn move the bishop next to 
the knight to the space the pawn has just vacated. Then that bishop might get an 
opportunity to capture the opponent's rook on the other side of the board.
* **FIDE** &mdash; Acronym of the International Chess Federation 
(F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale des &Eacute;checs).
* **File** &mdash; A column on a chessboard, generally notated with the 
lowercase letters 'a' to 'h'. At the beginning of the game, the rooks are on 
files 'a' and 'h', knights on files 'b' and 'g', bishops on files 'c' and 'f', 
queens on file 'd', and kings on file 'e'.
* **Fog of War** &mdash; A chess variant almost always played on a computer, in 
which each player can only see their own pieces and the spaces where their 
pieces may move to. This is, in my opinion, the most interesting variant of all. 
It is a little bit like Kriegspiel, which was invented long before anyone 
thought about using computers for chess in any capacity. Aside from the limited 
visibility, the only deviation from the traditional rules is that any check is 
checkmate. Thus castling tends to be more effective in Fog of War than in 
traditional chess.

## G

* **Gambit** &mdash; An opening in which a player risks a sacrifice. It is a 
gamble whether the opponent will take the bait or not.
* **GM** &mdash; Abbreviation for grandmaster.
* **Grandmaster** &mdash; A title awarded to the very best chess players. 

## H

* **Horde** &mdash; A chess variant in which White has only a bunch of pawns 
over most of the board. Horde is played on a standard board, but the radically 
different complement of pieces requires radically different rules. I played this 
variant once, I don't care to play it again.

## I

* **Inaccuracy** &mdash; A move that is just not all that good when a better 
move was possible. Some commentators use this term to mean bad moves that aren't bad 
enough to be considered mistakes or blunders.

## J

## K

* **K** &mdash; Notation for king.
* **King** &mdash; A player's most important chess piece, must be defended at 
all costs. The piece typically has a crown with a cross.
* **Kingside** &mdash; The half of the board with the kings at the beginning of 
the game, consisting of the files e, f, g and h. As an adjective, it refers to 
the pieces on that side of the board, or to an event on that side of the board.
* **Kingside castling** &mdash; Castling with the kingside rook.
* **Knight** &mdash; A piece shaped like a horse, the only one capable of 
jumping over other pieces. Each player gets two of them. At the beginning of the 
game, each knight is placed between a rook and a bishop.
* **Kriegspiel** &mdash; A variant of chess for two players and a referee using 
three boards. The referee's board starts out with all the White and Black 
pieces, the players' boards start out with only their own side's pieces. As the 
game progresses, the referee allows the players to learn of opponent pieces they 
may capture. It is quite a cumbersome precursor to Fog of War.

## L

## M

* **Mate** &mdash; Synonym for checkmate. Theoretically it could also be used as 
a synonym for stalemate, but I have never seen it used that way.
* **Middlegame** &mdash; A stage of the game beginning after the opening but 
ending before the endgame. In my opinion, among players of equal ability, the 
middlegame begins when both players have mobilized every piece they want to 
mobilize (and castled if they so desired and were able to), and ends when 
stalemate becomes a possibility. 
* **Missed win** &mdash; When a player fails to notice an opportunity for 
checkmate.
* **Mistake** &mdash; A technically valid move that puts the player at a 
tactical disadvantage. It's the result of either carelessness or misjudging the 
position. Getting the king out of a check is never a mistake, even if it forces 
the player to abandon a piece they would rather not. Some commentators use this 
term to mean only bad moves that waste a tactical advantage but don't risk 
losing the game.

## N

* **N** &mdash; Notation for knight (K is for king).

## O

* **O-O** &mdash; Notation for kingside castling.
* **O-O-O** &mdash; Notation for queenside castling.
* **Opening** &mdash; A player's first few moves. To my knowledge I've never 
seen this term in regards to chess used to mean a vulnerability in the 
opponent's defense. Most openings are given special names, which won't be listed 
in this document.

## P

* **Pawn** &mdash; The lowest ranking pieces, each player gets eight of them. 
Pawns are notated by their position, without the letter P.
* **Promotion** &mdash; When a pawn reaches the opponent's home row, it is 
promoted to a queen, bishop, knight or rook. Players almost always choose a 
queen. Theoretically this could lead to a total of eighteen queens on the board. 
But in competitive play, even with players of disparate ability, more than four 
queens total are highly unlikely.

## Q

* **Q** &mdash; Notation for queen.
* **Queen** &mdash; A player's most powerful piece, combining the capabilities 
of the bishop and the rook. The piece typically has a crown without a cross.
* **Queenside** &mdash; The half of the board with the queens at the beginning 
of the game, consisting of the files a, b, c and d. As an adjective, it refers 
to the pieces on that side of the board.
* **Queenside castling** &mdash; Castling with the queenside rook.

## R

* **R** &mdash; Notation for rook.
* **Rank** &mdash; A row on a chessboard, generally notated with the digits 1 to 
8, which follow the letter for the file. White pawns should be on rank 2 at the 
beginning of the game, Black pawns on rank 7. 
* **Rapid chess** &mdash; A timed game with each player getting 20 or 25 minutes 
each. Compare ''blitz chess''.
* **Rook** &mdash; A piece shaped like a tower, capable of moving in straight 
lines provided there are no pieces of its own side in the way. Each player gets 
two of them. At the beginning of the game, the four rooks are placed on the four 
corners of the board.

## S

* **Sacrifice** &mdash; When a player deliberately allows one of their pieces to 
be captured by the opponent in order to gain a tactical advantage. The way I see 
it, tactical intent is a crucial component of sacrifice. That is to say, it's 
not a sacrifice if a piece gets captured because the player losing the piece was 
careless, or because the opponent forced the player to give up a piece so as to 
get the king out of check, or to not lose a more valuable piece than the piece 
that gets captured.
* **Stalemate** &mdash; When a player is not in check but is unable to make any 
move whatsoever. For example, if the king is safe in its current space but would 
be in check if it moves in any direction, the remaining pawns are stymied by 
opposing pawns, and other pieces are pinned because moving them would leave the 
king exposed.

## T

* **Tempo** &mdash; As I understand this chess term, a tempo is simply a 
player's turn. However, this term is generally used in connection to momentum: 
gaining it or losing it. For example, a series of checks that don't immediately 
lead to an opportunity for checkmate would still be worthwhile if you capture 
some important pieces, or even just pawns standing in your way. You would be 
said to have gained tempo, and your opponent would be said to have lost tempo.

## U

* **Underpromotion** &mdash; When a pawn, upon reaching the opponent's home row, 
is promoted to a bishop, knight or rook rather than a queen. Since a queen 
combines the capabilities of a bishop and a rook, the underpromotion is obvious. 
Despite the knight's ability to jump over other pieces, this choice for 
promotion is generally less advantageous than choosing a queen.
* **Unforced error** &mdash; Synonym for blunder.

## V

* **Variant** &mdash; A version of chess that differs in some way from the 
traditional game. At the very least, a variant has different rules. More radical 
variants may use different boards and/or different pieces.
* **Variation** &mdash; A version of a well-known opening or strategy.

## W

* **White** &mdash; The player who always goes first, or the group of pieces 
that player controls. Depending on the chess set, the pieces may actually be a 
light brown color, or some other light color.

## X

* **x** &mdash; Notation for capture.

## Y

## Z
