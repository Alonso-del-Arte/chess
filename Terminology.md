# Terminology

Like law, mathematics, and just about anything else, chess has its own 
terminology, some of it more obvious than others.

This is not intended to be comprehensive. I only intend to include the most 
commonly used terms, and those which might cause me confusion because they're 
common words used to mean somewhat different things in chess.

I also don't intend this document to conform to any official reference. 

## A

* **Accuracy** &mdash; How well someone plays. The fewer blunders, the higher 
the accuracy. Winning is good, winning with high accuracy is better. On some 
chess websites, accuracy is measured by how much one plays as the website's best 
program would play.

## B

* **B** &mdash; Notation for bishop.
* **Bishop** &mdash; Pieces which flank the king and queen at the beginning of 
the game, each player gets two of them. They move diagonally, provided no pieces 
of their own side are in the way. 
* **Black** &mdash; The player who always goes second, or the group of pieces 
that player controls. Depending on the chess set, the pieces may actually be a 
dark brown color, or some other dark color.
* **Blunder** &mdash; A very bad mistake that could cost the player the game.

## C

* **Castling** &mdash; A special move in which the king and a rook come together 
for the king's protection. See the game rules for details.
* **Check** &mdash; A threat of capture to a player's king. The checked player 
must get their king out of danger, even if it means allowing some other piece to 
be captured.
* **Checkmate** &mdash; A threat of capture to a player's king with no means of 
escape. Depending on context, checkmates may be considered checks.

## D

## E

* **Endgame** &mdash; The last few moves of a game in which most or all pieces 
have moved from their initial positions. Among players of roughly equal ability, 
both players have had pieces captured but usually both players still have pawns 
left.
* **En passant** &mdash; A special move in which a pawn captures an opponent 
pawn. See the game rules for details.

## F

* **File** &mdash; A column on a chessboard, generally notated with the 
lowercase letters 'a' to 'h'. At the beginning of the game, the rooks are on 
files 'a' and 'h', knights on files 'b' and 'g', bishops on files 'c' and 'f', 
queens on file 'd', and kings on file 'e'.  

## G

* **Gambit** &mdash; An opening in which a player risks a sacrifice. It is a 
gamble whether the opponent will take the bait or not.

## H

## I

* **Inaccuracy** &mdash; A move that is just not all that good when a better 
move was possible. Some commentators use this term to mean bad moves that aren't bad 
enough to be considered mistakes or blunders.

## J

## K

* **K** &mdash; Notation for king.
* **King** &mdash; A player's most important chess piece, must be defended at 
all costs. The piece typically has a crown with a cross.
* **Kingside** &mdash; The half of the board with the kings at the beginning of 
the game, consisting of the files e, f, g and h. As an adjective, it refers to 
the pieces on that side of the board, or to an event on that side of the board.
* **Kingside castling** &mdash; Castling with the kingside rook.
* **Knight** &mdash; A piece shaped like a horse, the only one capable of 
jumping over other pieces. Each player gets two of them. At the beginning of the 
game, each knight is placed between a rook and a bishop.

## L

## M

* **Mate** &mdash; Synonym for checkmate.
* **Missed win** &mdash; When a player fails to notice an opportunity for 
checkmate.
* **Mistake** &mdash; A technically valid move that puts the player at a 
tactical disadvantage. It's the result of either carelessness or misjudging the 
position. Getting the king out of a check is never a mistake, even if it forces 
the player to abandon a piece they would rather not. Some commentators use this 
term to mean only bad moves that waste a tactical advantage but don't risk 
losing the game.

## N

* **N** &mdash; Notation for knight (K is for king).

## O

* **O-O** &mdash; Notation for kingside castling.
* **O-O-O** &mdash; Notation for queenside castling.
* **Opening** &mdash; A player's first few moves. To my knowledge I've never 
seen this term in regards to chess used to mean a vulnerability in the 
opponent's defense. Most openings are given special names, which won't be listed 
in this document.

## P

* **Pawn** &mdash; The lowest ranking pieces, each player gets eight of them. 
Pawns are notated by their position, without the letter P.
* **Promotion** &mdash; When a pawn reaches the opponent's home row, it is 
promoted to a queen, bishop, knight or rook. Players almost always choose a 
queen. Theoretically this could lead to a total of eighteen queens on the board. 
But in competitive play, even with players of disparate ability, more than four 
queens total are highly unlikely.

## Q

* **Q** &mdash; Notation for queen.
* **Queen** &mdash; A player's most powerful piece, combining the capabilities 
of the bishop and the rook. The piece typically has a crown without a cross.
* **Queenside** &mdash; The half of the board with the queens at the beginning 
of the game, consisting of the files a, b, c and d. As an adjective, it refers 
to the pieces on that side of the board.
* **Queenside castling** &mdash; Castling with the queenside rook.

## R

* **R** &mdash; Notation for rook.
* **Rank** &mdash; A row on a chessboard, generally notated with the digits 1 to 
8, which follow the letter for the file. White pawns should be on rank 2 at the 
beginning of the game, Black pawns on rank 7. 
* **Rook** &mdash; A piece shaped like a tower, capable of moving in straight 
lines provided there are no pieces of its own side in the way. Each player gets 
two of them. At the beginning of the game, the four rooks are placed on the four 
corners of the board.

## S

* **Sacrifice** &mdash; When a player deliberately allows one of their pieces to 
be captured by the opponent in order to gain a tactical advantage. The way I see 
it, tactical intent is a crucial component of sacrifice. That is to say, it's 
not a sacrifice if a piece gets captured because the player losing the piece was 
careless, or because the opponent forced the player to give a piece so as to get 
the king out of check, or to not lose a more valuable piece than the piece that 
gets captured. 

## T

* **Tempo** &mdash; As I understand this chess term, a tempo is simply a 
player's turn. However, this term is generally used in connection to momentum: 
gaining it or losing it. For example, a series of checks that don't immediately 
lead to an opportunity for checkmate would still be worthwhile if you capture 
some important pieces, or even just pawns standing in your way. You would be 
said to have gained tempo, and your opponent would be said to have lost tempo.

## U

* **Underpromotion** &mdash; When a pawn, upon reaching the opponent's home row, 
is promoted to a bishop, knight or rook rather than a queen. Since a queen 
combines the capabilities of a bishop and a rook, the underpromotion is obvious. 
Despite the knight's ability to jump over other pieces, this choice for 
promotion is generally less advantageous than choosing a queen.
* **Unforced error** &mdash; Synonym for blunder.

## V

## W

* **White** &mdash; The player who always goes first, or the group of pieces 
that player controls. Depending on the chess set, the pieces may actually be a 
light brown color, or some other light color.

## X

* **x** &mdash; Notation for capture.

## Y

## Z
