A puzzle is a chess position [FINISH WRITING]

Puzzles help beginners learn the tactics of the game. I think they can also be 
useful for testing how good a chess program is at strategy more than one move

## Endgame puzzles

One classic endgame puzzle teaches that sometimes you have to sacrifice your 
queen to get the checkmate. For example:

If you're playing White, you need to move your queen to the last rank, even 
though your opponent will certainly capture your queen with their rook. And 
if you're playing Black, you hope your opponent doesn't do that.
