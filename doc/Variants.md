# Variants

There are several variants of chess. The following is not a complete list. These 
are arranged roughly in order from closest to traditional chess to farthest 
away.

## Three-check

First side to put the other in check thrice wins the game. Or you can win with a 
regular checkmate before getting three checks.

## Fog of War

At the beginning of the game, you can only see the half of the board with your 
pieces. As you move your pieces, your view of the board changes according to 
what spaces of the board your pieces can move to. Your opponent likewise has a 
limited view of the board. It is a one-check game. Therefore, castling is 
generally advantageous.

## King of the hill

Four squares in the center of the board, d4, e4, d5 and e5, are marked as a 
special area. If one side can get their king to one of those squares, they win 
the game. Or you can win with a regular checkmate.

## Crazyhouse

Captures give the capturing side the ability to place a piece of the same kind 
on an empty square as a move later on. For example, if White captures a Black 
knight, White can later place a White knight on an empty square later.

The notation for crazyhouse is the same as regular chess except for the use of 
the symbol '@' for placements.
