# A few notable games

## Notable in regard to the rules of the game

### Regarding castling

In a 1994 blitz game, Kasparov might have beaten Aleksey Dreev if Kasparov had 
called Dreev out for castling illegally. Kasparov played White, Dreev Black.

The game started out plainly enough: 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. 
f4 c5 6. Nf3 Qb6 7. Be3 Nc6 8. Na4 Qa5+ 9. c3 c4 10. b4 Qc7 11. g4 b5 12. Nc5 
a5. Then: 13.a3 Nxc5 14. bxc5 Be7 15. Bh3 h5 16. gxh5.

Dreev decides to stop that White pawn's incursion with his rook, then moves the 
rook back to its starting position on his next turn.

16. ... Rxh5

17. Bg4 Rh8 

The game continues, Dreev moves his other rook, etc. 18. h4 Rb8 19. Bd2 b4 20. 
axb4 axb4 21. cxb4 Nxb4 22. Bxb4 Rxb4 23. Rb1 Qb7 24. Rxb4 Qxb4+ 25. Kf2 Bd7 26. 
h5 Ba4 27. Qa1 c3 28. Rb1 Qc4 29. Rb8+ Bd8 30. Qb1.

FEN: 1R1bk2r/5pp1/4p3/2PpP2P/b1qP1PB1/2p2N2/5K2/1Q6 b - - 5 30

This is a crucial juncture. Kasparov might have been hoping to play 31. Rxd8+, 
in which case Dreev would not have been able to castle. But Dreev had apparently 
forgotten he had already lost the right to castle kingside when he played 16. 
... Rxh5. 

Since Kasparov failed to notice that 30. ... O-O was an illegal move, the game 
went on and Dreev won. On review, the move 30. ... O-O was stricken from the 
transcript, as well as every move after that, but Dreev's win was allowed to 
stand.

## Notable for appearing in a TV show not specifically about chess

### Star Trek

*Star Trek*, retroactively referred to as "the original series" (TOS) introduced 
3D chess. However, sequel series sometimes showed games of traditional chess. In 
at least two cases, these games were historical games available to the show's writers.

#### Donald Byrne vs. Bobby Fischer

This game was played in New York on October 17, 1956 in competition for the 
Rosenwald Trophy. The game started thus: 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. d4 
O-O 5. Bf4 d5 6. Qb3 dxc4 7. Qxc4 c6 8. e4 Nbd7 9. Rd1 Nb6 10. Qc5 Bg4 11. Bg5 
Na4 12. Qa3 Nxc3 13. bxc3 Nxe4.

In the *Star Trek: Deep Space Nine* episode "Playing God," Commander Benjamin 
Sisko (Avery Brooks) and Lt. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) play a game of chess 
that looks to be precisely this Byrne-Fischer game. Sisko is repeating Byrne's 
moves and Dax is repeating Fischer's moves. Their conversation is only 
intermittently about the game.

14. Bxe7 

&mdash; Sisko: Your move. Your seaweed's been safely transported to the science 
lab.

&mdash; Dax: Did you take a look at it? 

14. ... Qb6 

They continue discussing the "seaweed" and Arjun, a young man hoping to be 
selected to be a "joined Trill."

15. Bc4 Nxc3 
16. Bc5 

&mdash; Dax: I'm not sure what he brings as a host, how he'll advance the 
symbiont to the next level. Frankly, he's more than a little arrogant, Benjamin.

&mdash; Sisko: Is he?

&mdash; Dax: Okay, for a Trill, that's to be expected. Check. But he's riding 
his father's ambitions and he doesn't have any idea what he'd do with a symbiont 
if he got one. 

16. ... Rfe8+ 

In real life, it must've been extremely obvious to Byrnes why Fischer moved his 
rook from the file 'f' to file 'e', and so there was no need for Fischer to 
announce the check.

17. Kf1 Be6 
18. Bxb6 Bxc4+

We don't see whether they keep playing the game, much less whether or not they 
deviate from the Byrnes-Fischer game. If they don't,
