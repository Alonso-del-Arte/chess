# A few notable games

## Notable for appearing in a TV show not specifically about chess

### Star Trek

*Star Trek*, retroactively referred to as "the original series" (TOS) introduced 
3D chess. However, sequel series sometimes showed games of traditional chess. In 
at least two cases, these games were historical games available to the show's writers.

#### Donald Byrne vs. Bobby Fischer

This game was played in New York on October 17, 1956 in competition for the 
Rosenwald Trophy. The game started thus: 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. d4 
O-O 5. Bf4 d5 6. Qb3 dxc4 7. Qxc4 c6 8. e4 Nbd7 9. Rd1 Nb6 10. Qc5 Bg4 11. Bg5 
Na4 12. Qa3 Nxc3 13. bxc3 Nxe4.

In the *Star Trek: Deep Space Nine* episode "Playing God," Commander Benjamin 
Sisko (Avery Brooks) and Lt. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) play a game of chess 
that looks to be precisely this Byrne-Fischer game. Sisko is repeating Byrne's 
moves and Dax is repeating Fischer's moves. Their conversation is only 
intermittently about the game.

14. Bxe7 

&mdash; Sisko: Your move. Your seaweed's been safely transported to the science 
lab.
&mdash; Dax: Did you take a look at it? 

14. ... Qb6 

They continue discussing the "seaweed" and Arjun, a young man hoping to be 
selected to be a "joined Trill."

15. Bc4 Nxc3 
16. Bc5 

&mdash; Dax: I'm not sure what he brings as a host, how he'll advance the 
symbiont to the next level. Frankly, he's more than a little arrogant, Benjamin.
&mdash; Sisko: Is he?
&mdash; Dax: Okay, for a Trill, that's to be expected. Check. But he's riding 
his father's ambitions and he doesn't have any idea what he'd do with a symbiont 
if he got one. 

16. ... Rfe8+ 

In real life, it must've been extremely obvious to Byrnes why Fischer moved his 
rook from the file 'f' to file 'e', and so there was no need for Fischer to 
announce the check.

18. Bxb6 Bxc4+

We don't see whether they keep playing the game, much less whether or not they 
deviate from the Byrnes-Fischer game. If they don't,
