# Notation of chess games

Chess games are usually notated in two columns, each column having a number, a 
notation for White's move and a notation for Black's move (except the last 
column if White wins or causes a stalemate). Since White always goes first, 
there's no need to label the columns.

1. [notation for White's first move] [notation for Black's first move]
2. [notation for White's second move] [notation for Black's second move]
3. [notation for White's third move] [notation for Black's third move]
4. etc.

The "officer" pieces are each represented by a single letter. It varies from 
language to language, but since English has become the de facto lingua franca of 
chess, the English words for the pieces inform the most commonly used letter 
assignments:

 * K for king
 * Q for queen
 * B for bishop
 * N for knight (because K is already taken by the king, and the K in "knight" 
 is silent anyway)
 * R for rook

Because kingside castling and queenside castling are special moves, they get 
special notations: O-O for kingside castling and O-O-O for queenside castling.

As for the pawns, 

## Algebraic notation

As someone who's studied algebraic number theory, I don't see what's so 
"algebraic" about chess algebraic notation. So-called algebraic notation has 
become so standard it might eventually be called just "notation" and 
occasionally "standard notation" to distinguish it from other notations.
