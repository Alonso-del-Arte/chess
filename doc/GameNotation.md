# Notation of chess games

Chess games are usually notated in two columns, each column having a number, a 
notation for White's move and a notation for Black's move (except the last 
column if White wins or causes a stalemate). Since White always goes first, 
there's no need to label the columns.

1. [notation for White's first move] [notation for Black's first move]
2. [notation for White's second move] [notation for Black's second move]
3. [notation for White's third move] [notation for Black's third move]
4. etc.

The "officer" pieces are each represented by a single letter. It varies from 
language to language, but since English has become the de facto lingua franca of 
chess, the English words for the pieces inform the most commonly used letter 
assignments:

 * K for king
 * Q for queen
 * B for bishop
 * N for knight (because K is already taken by the king, and the K in "knight" 
 is silent anyway)
 * R for rook

Because kingside castling and queenside castling are special moves, they get 
special notations: O-O for kingside castling and O-O-O for queenside castling.

As for the pawns, that depends on which system of notation we're using.

## Algebraic notation

As someone who's studied algebraic number theory, I don't see what's so 
"algebraic" about chess algebraic notation. So-called algebraic notation has 
become so standard it might eventually be called just "notation" and 
occasionally "standard notation" to distinguish it from other notations.

On the very first move, no capture is possible. This means that a pawn on a 
player's very first move can only move forward one or two spaces. Therefore, in 
algebraic notation, we write what file the pawn started on ('a' through 'h') and 
what rank that pawn ends on (3 or 4 for White, 6 or 5 for Black).

For example, if White opens with the king's pawn forward two spaces and Black 
responds with the queen's pawn forward two spaces, that would be notated

1. e4 d5

If Black instead responded with the kingside bishop's pawn, that would be 
notated

1. e4 f5

Either way, a capture is possible for White on the next move. That would be 
notated with the file the capturing pawn was on, followed by the lowercase 
letter 'x', then the file and rank of the captured piece. Our game transcript 
thus far would be either

1. e4 d5
2. exd5

or 

1. e4 d5
2. exf5
