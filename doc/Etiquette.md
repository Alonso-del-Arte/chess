# Chess etiquette

Chess players are usually thought of as being polite and reserved. However, 
aside from the touch-move rule, there is very little in the rules of the game 
regulating what is polite behavior.

## General principles

One should always play to the best of one's ability, except within the context 
of coaching or testing. A player should do everything he can to win that is 
allowed under the rules of the game, and under the rules of the tournament when 
applicable.

However, when it is clear that one has lost, one should resign rather than drag 
the game out to checkmate by the opponent. If the opponent is considered to be 
very good, dragging the game out could be seen as an insult, meaning that the 
player believes that the opponent will make a blunder big enough to put the 
opponent's victory in doubt.

## One last word about the touch-move rule

It would be rude to repeatedly touch pieces that can't be moved at the moment, 
like any of the rooks at the very beginning of the game, without adjusting them 
within their squares and without announcing one's intention to do that.

However, that kind of behavior is technically within the letter of the rules. 
It's obviously against the spirit of the rules.
