# Chess etiquette

Chess players are usually thought of as being polite and reserved. However, 
aside from the touch-move rule, there is very little in the rules of the game 
regulating what is polite behavior.

## General principles

One should always play to the best of one's ability, except within the context 
of coaching or testing. A player should do everything he can to win that is 
allowed under the rules of the game, and under the rules of the tournament when 
applicable.

However, when it is clear that one has lost, one should resign rather than drag 
the game out to checkmate by the opponent. If the opponent is considered to be 
very good, dragging the game out could be seen as an insult, meaning that the 
player believes that the opponent will make a blunder big enough to put the 
opponent's victory in doubt.

## Talking during games

Talking is not allowed during competitive games, except under certain 
circumstances for matters directly related to the progress of the game. In a 
coaching context, the conversation should probably still be limited to matters 
pertinent to the game.

Even in a friendly game, it might be best to limit off-topic conversation, as 
your opponent might think you're trying to cause a distraction.

### Adjusting pieces

For the most part, pieces on the board should only be moved when being moved, 
captured or promoted. And it's okay if a piece is slightly off-center. But if a 
piece is so off-center that its position is ambiguous, it should be adjusted.

Before adjusting any piece, announce your intention to do so by saying 
"J'adoube," French for "I adjust" (if you don't know how to say it in the 
official language of the tournament, just use the French phrase).

It is important to make these announcements during your own turn, especially in 
a timed game. Making adjustments on your opponent's turn could be construed as 
an attempt to create a distraction.

### Calling checks

Among beginners, it might be necessary for a player to announce a check, just in 
case the opponent fails to notice it. At any higher level, checks should not be 
announced, even if you believe your opponent is about to make an invalid move 
that ignores the check.

If your opponent does make such an invalid move, then you might say something 
like "You're in check."

## One last word about the touch-move rule

It would be rude to repeatedly touch pieces that can't be moved at the moment, 
like any of the rooks at the very beginning of the game, without adjusting them 
within their squares and without announcing one's intention to do that.

However, that kind of behavior is technically within the letter of the rules. 
It's obviously against the spirit of the rules.
