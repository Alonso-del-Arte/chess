# Openings and Defenses

At the beginning of the game, White has only twenty possible moves: move one of the two knights to the left or to the right, or move one of the eight pawns one space forward or two. Of those twenty possible openings, players tend to use only four or five of those.

Some openings are more advantageous than others, but remember: good players 

Theoretically, Black could choose any of the twenty possible moves to respond regardless of White's first move, but the vast majority of players and programs choose a first move that they believe will best counter White's intentions.

## Knight openings

### Queenside knight to rook's file: Durkin opening, or "Sodium Attack"

1. Na3

Most openings are named after people. This one's named after Robert T. Durkin. The nickname "Sodium Attack" comes from 

I believe all grandmasters have thought about this opening, and may have even played it in a friendly game. But I also believe that they have all concluded that the element of surprise is not a good enough reason to choose it over the other knight openings.

## Pawn one space forward

These openings strike me as particularly cautious. Some of them are just as good as their corresponding two-spaces-forward openings for mobilizing the queen and the bishops, while perhaps offering some protection

### Anderssen opening (queenside rook's pawn)

1. a3

### Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack (queenside knight's pawn)

1. b3
