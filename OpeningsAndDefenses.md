# Openings and Defenses

At the beginning of the game, White has only twenty possible moves: move one of the two knights to the left or to the right, or move one of the eight pawns one space forward or two. Of those twenty possible openings, players tend to use only four or five of those.

Some openings are more advantageous than others, but remember: good players can often figure out how to overcome disadvantages, and bad players can often squander advantages.

Theoretically, Black could choose any of the twenty possible moves to respond regardless of White's first move, but the vast majority of players and programs choose a first move that they believe will best counter White's perceived intentions.

## Knight openings

Either knight for a first move perhaps signals an intention to castle on that knight's side, at least in regular chess. Knight openings have their pros and cons for the Fog of War chess variant. On the one hand, you don't get to see anything of your opponent's forces, but on the other hand you know them to be at initial state at this point.

### Queenside knight to rook's file: Durkin opening, or "Sodium Attack"

1. Na3

Most openings are named after people. This one's named after Robert T. Durkin. The nickname "Sodium Attack" comes from the notation "Na" (the chemical symbol for sodium); moving the same knight to the other side would be notated Nc3.

I believe all grandmasters have thought about this opening, and may have even played it in a friendly game. But I also believe that they have all concluded that the element of surprise is not a good enough reason to choose it over the other knight openings.

However, I must acknowledge that Durkin himself won a few games with this opening. He liked this opening so much he even wrote a pamphlet about it.

### Queenside knight to bishop's file: Van Geet opening

1. Nc3

This is a much more conventional opening. It helps clear the way for queenside castling, and it better positions your knight to rampage through your opponent's ranks.

### Kingside knight to bishop's file: R&eacute;ti opening

1. Nf3

Opponent might respond with the reversed Mexican defense

### Kingside knight to rook's file: Amar opening

1. Nh3

Black will probably respond by moving their queen's pawn one or two spaces forward, in either case threatening your knight with their queenside bishop right off the bat.

## Pawn two spaces forward

Since pawns can initially move forward two spaces, it makes sense to take advantage of this from the beginning of the game. Your opponent might respond by moving their corresponding pawn forward two spaces, effectively stymying both pawns until such time as either one of them can capture or is itself captured.

Another option is that your opponent might offer a pawn sacrifice. Then it'll be up to you to decide to take them up on it or pass it up.

Or, perhaps better, they might move a pawn that neither stymies your pawn nor threatens to capture, as they're more interested in mobilizing their own pieces.

### Queenside rook's pawn: Ware opening

1. a4

This is a good way to get the queenside rook going, if you're not interested in queenside castling.

### Queenside knight's pawn: Polish opening

1. b4

This doesn't immediately help the queenside rook get out,

Potential responses: Kucharkowski-Meybohm gambit, Birmingham gambit 

### Queenside bishop's pawn: English opening

1. c4

Opponent might respond with the Anglo-Indian defense

1 c4 Nf6

### Queen's pawn opening

1. d4

Apparently this one doesn't have a special name.

It's a weak opening, in my opinion. Your opponent might respond with the Horwitz defense, putting your king in check on barely the second move.

1. d4 e6
2. Qd3 Bb4+

Or your opponent might respond with the Keres defense, once again putting you in check not even three moves into the game.

1. d4 e6
2. c4 Bb4+

But you can still win if your opponent fails to keep up momentum after that early advantage.

Or the Amazon defense, if your opponent is not interested in delivering early checks.

1. d4 d5
2. Qd3 Nf6

Or the Amazon attack

1. d4 d5
2. Qd3 Qd6

### King's pawn: Tortoise opening

1. e4

On the one hand, this might feel like you're leaving your king unprotected right off the bat. But remember: your opponent hasn't begun mobilizing yet. Follow this opening by mobilizing your queen and kingside bishop.

### Kingside bishop's pawn: Bird's opening

1. f4

If you use this opening, be absolutely certain to also open an avenue of escape for your king, or else risk an embarrassingly early checkmate. Like this:

1. f4 e6
2. g4 Qh4#

### Kingside knight's pawn: Grob opening

1. g4

### Kingside rook's pawn: K&aacute;das opening

1. h4

## Pawn one space forward

These openings strike me as particularly cautious. Some of them are just as good as their corresponding two-spaces-forward openings for mobilizing the queen and the bishops, while perhaps offering some more protection for the king than two-spaces-forward pawn openings.

### Queenside rook's pawn: Anderssen opening

1. a3

### Queenside knight's pawn: Nimzowitsch-Larsen attack 

1. b3

### Queenside bishop's pawn: Saragossa opening

1. c3

### Queen's pawn: Mieses opening

1. d3

### King's pawn: Van't Kruijs opening

1. e3

### Kingside bishop's pawn: Barnes opening

1. f3

This is a particularly bad opening, in my opinion. It exposes your king to check from your opponent's queen or kingside bishop very early on, and it makes mobilizing your own queen and bishops rather awkward.

If you use this opening, be absolutely certain to also open an avenue of escape for your king, or else risk an embarrassingly early checkmate. Like this:

1. f3 e6
2. g4 Qh4#

### Kingside knight's pawn: King's Fianchetto opening

1. g3

### Kingside rook's pawn: Clemenz opening

1. h3
